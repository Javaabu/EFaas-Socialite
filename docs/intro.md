# Efaas-Socialite 

## Introduction
Efaas-Socialite can help you integrate EFaas sign in capabilities to your application so that your users can use Efaas to sign in to your application securely without directly registering on the website you're making. 

This package is simply a driver for [Laravel's Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite), therefore, prior installation of [`laravel/socialite`](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite) is required.
